# Lesson 2.4: While Loops

# Loops are an important concept in computer programming.
# Loops let us run blocks of code many times which can be
# really useful when we have to repeat tasks.

# This uses a while loop to remove all the spaces from a string of
# text. Can you figure out how it works?

# Define a procedure, print_numbers, that takes
# as input a positive whole number, and prints
# out all the whole numbers from 1 to the input
# number.

# Make sure your procedure prints "upwards", so
# from 1 up to the input number.

def print_numbers(n_max):
    count = 1
    while count <= n_max:
        print count
        count += 1

print_numbers(3)
#>>> 1
#>>> 2
#>>> 3
